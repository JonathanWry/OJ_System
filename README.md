# Online Judgement System(updating)

This is an Online Judgement (OJ) system for coding challenges and evaluations, mimicing Leetcode. The project consists of three main components: backend, frontend, and the CodeSandbox, each serving a specific purpose in the overall functionality of the system.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Built with Java, Spring Boot, and Alibaba SpringCloud, the backend handles user requests, authentication, and the core functionality of the Online Judgement system.
  
- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed with Vue.js, providing users with an interactive interface to submit coding challenges, view results, and track progress.

- **CodeSandbox**: The CodeSandbox is responsible for compiling and running user-submitted code in an isolated environment. It is implemented using Java.
